### üì¶ Install Dependencies

#### üì¶ Method 1: Poetry (Recommended)

Use [**Poetry**](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. It handles dependencies, virtual environments, and locking versions more efficiently than pip. To install dependencies using Poetry:

- **Option 1 [Recommended]**: Install exact dependency versions specified in [**poetry.lock**](./poetry.lock) for consistent environments:

  ```bash
  poetry install
  ```

- **Option 2**: Install the latest compatible dependency versions from [**pyproject.toml**](./pyproject.toml) and regenerate the [**poetry.lock**](./poetry.lock) file:

  ```bash
  poetry install --no-root
  ```

#### üì¶ Method 2: Pip

Install all dependencies listed in [**requirements.txt**](./requirements.txt) using [**pip**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### üåê Connection Issues

If you encounter connection issues during installation, you can try extending the **timeout** and increasing the number of **retries** with the following:

- **For Poetry**: Use the following command to set the retries and timeout directly in the terminal **before running the install**:
  - **Windows**:
    - **PowerShell**:

      ```bash
      $env:POETRY_HTTP_TIMEOUT=300
      $env:POETRY_HTTP_RETRIES=10
      ```

    - **Command Prompt**:

      ```bash
      set POETRY_HTTP_TIMEOUT=300
      set POETRY_HTTP_RETRIES=10
      ```

  - **Linux/macOS**:
    - **Terminal**:

      ```bash
      export POETRY_HTTP_TIMEOUT=300
      export POETRY_HTTP_RETRIES=10
      ```

- **For Pip**: Use the `--retries` and `--timeout` flags directly in your pip command:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt --retries 10 --timeout 300
  ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Usage Instructions

1. Open the root folder with [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (`Ctrl/Cmd + K` followed by `Ctrl/Cmd + O`).
1. Open `.ipynb` files using the [**Jupyter extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) integrated with **VS Code**.
1. Select the correct Python kernel and virtual environment where the dependencies were installed.
1. Allow **VS Code** to install any recommended dependencies for working with Jupyter Notebooks.

‚úçÔ∏è **Notes**:  

- It is **highly recommended** to stick with the exact dependency versions specified in [**poetry.lock**](./poetry.lock) or [**requirements.txt**](./requirements.txt) rather than using the latest package versions. The repository has been **tested** on these versions to ensure **compatibility** and **stability**.
- This repository is **actively maintained**, and dependencies are **updated regularly** to the latest **stable** versions.
- The **table of contents** embedded in the **notebooks** may not function correctly on **GitHub**.
- For an improved experience, open the notebooks **locally** or view them via [**nbviewer**](https://nbviewer.org/github/mr-pylin/pytorch-workshop).
