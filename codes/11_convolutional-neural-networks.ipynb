    "      - It refers to adding extra values (usually zeros) around the input tensor (signal or image) before applying the convolution operation\n",

    "      - `padding='same'`\n",

    "# Convolution in PyTorch\n",
    "   - Convolution operations (e.g. `nn.Conv1d`, `nn.Conv2d`) in PyTorch (and most deep learning frameworks) technically performs **correlation, not convolution!**\n",
    "   - Although the operation is named e.g. `Conv2d`, the correlation operation is preferred in practice for a few reasons\n",
    "      1. **Simplicity**:\n",
    "         - Correlation is easier to implement and understand since it doesn't require flipping the kernel\n",
    "      1. **Equivalence in Learning**:\n",
    "         - In the context of CNNs, the kernel weights are learned during training\n",
    "         - Since the kernels are learned, whether you use convolution or cross-correlation doesn't matter\n",
